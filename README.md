# NinjaQuest
Prototype for what would evolve into a group project for a Game Design and Development class I took at PSU

Includes the game's source code, the [JavaGameLibrary](https://github.com/jboby93/JavaGameLibrary) source code used to develop it, the game's image resources, and a crude room editor for the map.

Use the build script to compile the game, the run script to run it, or make an executable .jar with the makejar script.

See the included Readme-Game.txt or Readme-Source.txt for more info!
